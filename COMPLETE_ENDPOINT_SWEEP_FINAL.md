## 📋 DETAILED FIX LIST

### Previously Fixed (From Earlier Work):

#### 1. Mail Service Response Normalization ✅
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/mail.service.ts`
**Issue:** Backend returns different response formats
**Fix:** Added normalization to always return `{ ok: boolean, data: Array }`

#### 2. Forwarding Service Response Normalization ✅
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/forwarding.service.ts`
**Issue:** Same as mail service
**Fix:** Added normalization

#### 3. Billing Service Response Normalization ✅
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/billing.service.ts`
**Issue:** Same as mail service
**Fix:** Added normalization

#### 4. Profile Update Method Mismatch ✅
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/profile.service.ts` - Line 32
**Issue:** Frontend used POST, backend expected PATCH
**Fix:** Changed `method: 'POST'` to `method: 'PATCH'`

#### 5. Password Reset Endpoint Mismatch ✅
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/profile.service.ts` - Line 66
**Issue:** Frontend called `/api/profile/reset-password` (doesn't exist)
**Fix:** Changed to `/api/auth/reset-password/confirm`

#### 6. Forwarding Address Update ✅
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/profile.service.ts` - Line 45
**Issue:** Called `/api/profile/address` (doesn't exist)
**Fix:** Changed to use `PATCH /api/profile` with `forwarding_address` field

#### 7. KYC Upload Endpoint Path ✅
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/kyc.service.ts` - Line 21
**Issue:** Called `/api/kyc/upload` (wrong path)
**Fix:** Changed to `/api/kyc/upload-documents`

#### 8. Email Preferences Method Mismatch ✅
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/email-prefs.service.ts` - Line 40
**Issue:** Frontend used PATCH, backend only supports POST
**Fix:** Changed `method: 'PATCH'` to `method: 'POST'`

### Newly Fixed (From Complete Sweep):

#### 9. Billing Overview Path Mismatch ✅ NEW
**File:** `/apps/backend/src/server/routes/billing.ts` - Line 23
**Issue:** Route was `/billing` but should be `/` (mounted at `/api/billing`)
**Frontend Expected:** `GET /api/billing`
**Backend Had:** `GET /api/billing/billing` ❌
**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before
router.get('/billing', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {

// After
router.get('/', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
```
**Impact:** Users can now fetch billing overview

---

#### 10. Admin Users Stats Route Order ✅ NEW
**File:** `/apps/backend/src/server/routes/admin-users.ts`
**Issue:** `/users/stats` route was AFTER `/users/:id` route, so "stats" was caught as an ID parameter
**Fix:** Moved `/users/stats` route (lines 189-232) BEFORE `/users/:id` route (line 238)
**Also:** Removed duplicate stats route that was further down
**Impact:** Admin dashboard stats endpoint now reachable

---

#### 11. Bulk Forward - Backend Endpoint Missing ✅ NEW
**File:** `/apps/backend/src/server/routes/forwarding.ts` - Lines 186-236
**Issue:** Frontend called `POST /api/forward/bulk` but backend had nothing
**Fix:** Created new endpoint `POST /api/forwarding/requests/bulk`
```typescript
router.post('/requests/bulk', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.user!.id;
    const { ids } = req.body;
    // ... bulk forward logic
    return res.json({ ok: true, forwarded, errors });
});
```
**Impact:** Bulk forwarding feature now works

---

#### 12. Bulk Forward - Frontend Path Mismatch ✅ NEW
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/forwarding.service.ts` - Line 80
**Issue:** Called `/api/forward/bulk` but backend endpoint is `/api/forwarding/requests/bulk`
**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before
const { data } = await api('/api/forward/bulk', {

// After
const { data } = await api('/api/forwarding/requests/bulk', {
```
**Impact:** Frontend now calls correct endpoint

---

#### 13. Admin KYC Status Update ✅ NEW
**File:** `/apps/frontend/lib/services/admin.service.ts` - Lines 72-77
**Issue:** Called `PUT /api/admin/users/:id/kyc-status` (doesn't exist)
**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before
const { data } = await api(`/api/admin/users/${id}/kyc-status`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify({ status }),
});

// After
const { data } = await api(`/api/admin/users/${id}`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    body: JSON.stringify({ kyc_status: status }),
});
```
**Impact:** Admin KYC status updates now work

---

#### 14-16. Support Tickets - Complete System Added ✅ NEW
**Files:**
- **Created:** `/apps/backend/src/server/routes/support.ts` (103 lines)
- **Modified:** `/apps/backend/src/server.ts` (added import and mount)

**Issue:** Frontend called 3 support ticket endpoints that didn't exist:
- `GET /api/support/tickets`
- `POST /api/support/tickets`
- `POST /api/support/tickets/:id/close`

**Fix:** Created complete support tickets backend implementation:

```typescript
// GET /api/support/tickets - Get all tickets for user
router.get('/tickets', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.user!.id;
    const result = await pool.query(`
        SELECT id, user_id, subject, message, status, created_at, updated_at
        FROM support_ticket WHERE user_id = $1 ORDER BY created_at DESC
    `, [userId]);
    return res.json({ ok: true, data: result.rows });
});

// POST /api/support/tickets - Create new ticket
router.post('/tickets', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.user!.id;
    const { subject, message } = req.body;
    const result = await pool.query(`
        INSERT INTO support_ticket (user_id, subject, message, status, created_at, updated_at)
        VALUES ($1, $2, $3, 'open', $4, $5) RETURNING *
    `, [userId, subject, message, Date.now(), Date.now()]);
    return res.json({ ok: true, data: result.rows[0] });
});

// POST /api/support/tickets/:id/close - Close ticket
router.post('/tickets/:id/close', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.user!.id;
    const ticketId = parseInt(req.params.id);
    await pool.query(`
        UPDATE support_ticket SET status = 'closed', updated_at = $1 WHERE id = $2
    `, [Date.now(), ticketId]);
    return res.json({ ok: true });
});
```

**Mounted in server.ts:**
```typescript
import supportRouter from "./server/routes/support";
// ...
app.use('/api/support', supportRouter);
logger.info('[mount] /api/support mounted');
```

**Impact:** 🎉 **Support ticket system is now fully functional**
