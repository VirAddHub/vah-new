# Admin-Driven Forwarding System

## Overview

The VirtualAddressHub forwarding system is now fully admin-driven, eliminating the need for external cron jobs, outbox processing, or automated notifications. All forwarding requests are managed through a dedicated admin dashboard where operations staff can review, process, and track each request manually.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Complete web interface for managing forwarding requests
- ✅ **Status Workflow**: Clear progression from Requested → Reviewed → Processing → Dispatched → Delivered
- ✅ **Tracking Management**: Add courier information and tracking numbers
- ✅ **Admin Notes**: Add internal notes and comments
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all status changes
- ✅ **No External Dependencies**: No cron jobs, Zapier, or external services required

## System Architecture

### Database Schema

The `forwarding_request` table includes admin management fields:

```sql
-- Core request fields
id, user_id, mail_item_id, status, to_name, address1, address2, city, state, postal, country, reason, method, idem_key, created_at, updated_at

-- Admin management fields
reviewed_at, reviewed_by, processing_at, dispatched_at, delivered_at, cancelled_at, courier, tracking_number, admin_notes
```

### Status Flow

```
Requested → Reviewed → Processing → Dispatched → Delivered
     ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
  Cancelled  Cancelled  Cancelled    (Final)
```

### API Endpoints

#### Admin Endpoints (Protected by `requireAdmin` middleware)

- `GET /api/admin/forwarding/requests` - List forwarding requests with filtering
- `PATCH /api/admin/forwarding/requests/:id` - Update request status and details

#### User Endpoints (Unchanged)

- `POST /api/forwarding/requests` - Create new forwarding request
- `GET /api/forwarding/requests` - List user's forwarding requests

## Admin Dashboard Features

### Request List View

- **Status Filtering**: Filter by Requested, Reviewed, Processing, Dispatched, Delivered, Cancelled
- **Search**: Search by recipient name, postal code, courier, or tracking number
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh to see latest status changes

### Request Management

Each request card shows:
- **Recipient Details**: Name, full address, country
- **Mail Information**: Subject, tag, user email
- **Status Badge**: Color-coded status indicator
- **Tracking Info**: Courier and tracking number (if available)
- **Admin Notes**: Internal notes and comments
- **Timestamps**: Creation, review, processing, dispatch, delivery times
- **Action Buttons**: Context-sensitive actions based on current status

### Status Actions

#### Requested Status
- **Mark Reviewed**: Admin has reviewed the request
- **Start Processing**: Begin processing immediately
- **Cancel**: Cancel the request

#### Reviewed Status
- **Start Processing**: Begin processing the request
- **Cancel**: Cancel the request

#### Processing Status
- **Mark Dispatched**: Complete processing and dispatch (requires courier/tracking details)
- **Cancel**: Cancel the request

#### Dispatched Status
- **Mark Delivered**: Confirm delivery

### Dispatch Modal

When marking as "Dispatched", a modal appears to collect:
- **Courier**: Royal Mail, DHL, UPS, etc.
- **Tracking Number**: Package tracking reference
- **Admin Notes**: Additional internal notes

## Security

### Admin Authentication

- **Middleware**: `requireAdmin` checks for `user.is_admin` or `user.is_staff`
- **Route Protection**: All admin endpoints require authentication
- **Audit Logging**: All status changes are logged with admin ID

### Data Validation

- **Status Transitions**: Only valid status transitions are allowed
- **Input Sanitization**: All text inputs are properly sanitized
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries throughout

## Database Migration

Run the migration to add admin fields:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f apps/backend/migrations/027_admin_forwarding_system.sql
```

This adds:
- `reviewed_at`, `reviewed_by`, `processing_at`, `dispatched_at`, `delivered_at`, `cancelled_at`
- `courier`, `tracking_number`, `admin_notes`
- Indexes for efficient querying

## Frontend Implementation

### Admin Page Location
```
apps/frontend/app/admin/forwarding/page.tsx
```

### Key Components
- **Status Filter**: Dropdown to filter by status
- **Search Input**: Text search across multiple fields
- **Request Cards**: Individual request management cards
- **Dispatch Modal**: Modal for collecting dispatch details
- **Action Buttons**: Context-sensitive action buttons

### Styling
- Uses existing shadcn/ui components
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Color-coded status badges
- Clean, professional admin interface

## Workflow Examples

### Standard Processing Flow

1. **User Creates Request**: User submits forwarding request via frontend
2. **Admin Reviews**: Admin sees request in "Requested" status
3. **Admin Marks Reviewed**: Admin reviews details and marks as "Reviewed"
4. **Admin Starts Processing**: Admin begins physical processing
5. **Admin Dispatches**: Admin adds courier/tracking and marks "Dispatched"
6. **Admin Confirms Delivery**: Admin marks "Delivered" when confirmed

### Express Processing Flow

1. **User Creates Request**: User submits forwarding request
2. **Admin Starts Processing**: Admin immediately starts processing
3. **Admin Dispatches**: Admin adds courier/tracking and dispatches
4. **Admin Confirms Delivery**: Admin confirms delivery

### Cancellation Flow

1. **Any Status**: Admin can cancel from any status except "Delivered"
2. **Cancelled Status**: Request is marked as cancelled with timestamp
3. **No Further Actions**: Cancelled requests cannot be reactivated

## Benefits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Admin Can't Access Dashboard**
- Check user has `is_admin` or `is_staff` flag
- Verify JWT token is valid
- Check route permissions

**Status Updates Not Working**
- Verify status transition is allowed
- Check database connection
- Review error logs

**Search Not Working**
- Check search query format
- Verify database indexes exist
- Review query performance

### Debug Commands

```sql
-- Check admin users
SELECT id, email, is_admin, is_staff FROM "user" WHERE is_admin = true OR is_staff = true;

-- Check forwarding request statuses
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM forwarding_request GROUP BY status;

-- Check recent admin actions
SELECT * FROM forwarding_request WHERE reviewed_by IS NOT NULL ORDER BY reviewed_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

This admin-driven system provides complete control and visibility over the forwarding process while maintaining simplicity and reliability.
