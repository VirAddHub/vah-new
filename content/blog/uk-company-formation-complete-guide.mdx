## Types of UK Companies

Before starting, choose the right company structure:

- **Private Limited Company (Ltd):** Most common choice for small businesses
- **Public Limited Company (PLC):** For larger companies planning to go public

- **Community Interest Company (CIC):** For social enterprises

## Required Information

To incorporate a UK company, you'll need:

## Step-by-Step Process

Every company needs at least one director who is 16 or over. Directors can be individuals or corporate entities, but at least one must be a natural person.

### Step 3: Set Up Registered Office
This must be a UK address where official documents can be served. Consider using a professional virtual address service for privacy and credibility.

### Step 4: Create Share Structure
Decide on share capital, number of shares, and shareholding. The minimum share capital is £1, but consider future funding needs.

### Step 5: Prepare Incorporation Documents
You'll need:
- Memorandum of Association
- Articles of Association
- Form IN01 (application for registration)

### Step 6: Submit Application
File with Companies House online or by post. Online applications are processed faster and cost less.

## Post-Incorporation Tasks

Once your company is incorporated:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

## Ongoing Compliance

Remember, company formation is just the beginning. You'll need to:
