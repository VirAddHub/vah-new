â€¢ Individual business owners  
â€¢ Directors and anyone with significant control (e.g. UBOs/PSCs)  
â€¢ Anyone authorised to act on behalf of the business  

This is required under UK anti-money laundering (AML) rules (HMRC supervision). Where relevant, we may need to verify ultimate beneficial owners (typically individuals with 25% or more ownership or control).`,

2) Upload your Proof of Identity and Proof of Address.  
3) Provide basic business details and list any people with significant control (PSCs/UBOs).  
4) We run automated checks; if anything needs clarifying, our compliance team may email you for more information.  
5) Approval & address issued â€” you'll receive your official London address and dashboard access.  
6) Ongoing compliance â€” please keep your details up to date and tell us about any material changes (e.g. directors/ownership).`,

â€¢ Utility bill (gas, electricity, water, internet, landline)  
â€¢ Council tax or government-issued tax bill
