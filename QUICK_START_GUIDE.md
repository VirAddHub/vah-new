## 1️⃣ Database Migration (1 minute)

### Run Migration:
```bash
# Connect to your database and run:
psql $DATABASE_URL -f apps/backend/migrations/027_admin_forwarding_system.sql
```

### Verify Tables Created:
```sql
-- Check new tables exist
\dt forwarding_request
\dt forwarding_charge  
\dt forwarding_outbox
```

## 2️⃣ Deploy Code (Already Done ✅)

The admin-driven forwarding system is already integrated into your codebase:
- ✅ Admin dashboard created
- ✅ Admin routes and controllers
- ✅ Database schema updated
- ✅ Build successful

## 3️⃣ Access Admin Dashboard (2 minutes)

### Access Admin Dashboard:
1. **Login** as admin user (with `is_admin` or `is_staff` flag)
2. **Navigate** to `/admin/forwarding`
3. **View** forwarding request queue

### Admin Dashboard Features:
- **Status Filtering**: Filter by Requested, Reviewed, Processing, Dispatched, Delivered, Cancelled
- **Search**: Search by recipient name, postal code, courier, or tracking number
- **Action Buttons**: Context-sensitive actions based on current status
- **Dispatch Modal**: Add courier and tracking information

## 4️⃣ Test Workflow (5 minutes)

### Test Complete Workflow:
1. **Create Request**: User creates forwarding request via frontend
2. **Admin Reviews**: Admin sees request in "Requested" status
3. **Admin Processes**: Admin marks as "Reviewed" then "Processing"
4. **Admin Dispatches**: Admin adds courier/tracking and marks "Dispatched"
5. **Admin Delivers**: Admin confirms delivery and marks "Delivered"

### No Cron Jobs Needed! 🎉
- **Admin-Driven**: All processing done through web interface
- **No External Dependencies**: No Zapier, cron jobs, or external services
- **Full Control**: Complete visibility and control over all requests

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Admin Can't Access Dashboard**
- Check user has `is_admin` or `is_staff` flag in database
- Verify JWT token is valid
- Check route permissions

**Forwarding request fails**
- Check mail item exists and belongs to user
- Verify mail item is in `Pending` status
- Check for expired mail items

**Status updates not working**
- Verify status transition is allowed
- Check database connection
- Review error logs

### Debug Commands:

```sql
-- Check admin users
SELECT id, email, is_admin, is_staff FROM "user" WHERE is_admin = true OR is_staff = true;

-- Check forwarding request statuses
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM forwarding_request GROUP BY status;

-- Check recent admin actions
SELECT id, status, to_name, reviewed_by, created_at 
FROM forwarding_request 
WHERE reviewed_by IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```
