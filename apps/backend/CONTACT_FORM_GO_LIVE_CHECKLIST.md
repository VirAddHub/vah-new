## 🔧 Environment Configuration

### 1) Render Environment Variables (Backend)

**Required Variables:**
```bash
POSTMARK_TOKEN=pm_your_actual_token_here
# OR
POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN=pm_your_actual_token_here

POSTMARK_FROM=hello@virtualaddresshub.co.uk
POSTMARK_TO=support@virtualaddresshub.co.uk
POSTMARK_FROM_NAME=VirtualAddressHub Support
```

**Verification Steps:**
- [ ] Confirm `hello@virtualaddresshub.co.uk` is verified in Postmark
- [ ] Test token has `outbound` message stream access
- [ ] Verify sender domain is properly configured

### 2) Frontend Environment Variables

**For BFF Pattern (Recommended):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=""  # Empty = use BFF routes
```

**For Direct Backend (Development):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### 3) Smoke Tests

**Direct Backend Test:**
```bash
curl -s -i https://your-backend-domain.com/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name":"Test User",
    "email":"test@example.com",
    "subject":"Hello",
    "message":"Just testing",
    "website":""
  }'
```

**Expected Response:** `{"ok":true}`

**Frontend Form Test:**
```bash
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/contact.spec.ts
```

**Contract Tests:**
```bash
npm test tests/api.contact.contract.test.ts
```

### 4) Email Flow Verification

**Test Scenarios:**

- [ ] Invalid email → 400 error with validation message
- [ ] Honeypot filled → 422 spam detection
- [ ] Missing fields → 400 validation error
- [ ] Rate limit exceeded → 429 with friendly message

**Email Verification:**
- [ ] Notification email arrives at `support@virtualaddresshub.co.uk`
- [ ] Auto-reply sent to customer email
- [ ] Reply-To headers work correctly:
  - Team hits Reply → goes to customer
  - Customer replies to auto-reply → lands in support inbox

- [ ] Check rate limiting triggers
- [ ] Verify honeypot spam detection

**Performance Metrics:**
- [ ] Response times for contact endpoint
- [ ] Success/failure rates
- [ ] Rate limit hit frequency

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions
