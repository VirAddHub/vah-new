### 🔧 Environment Configuration

The contact form works with your existing backend configuration:

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
POSTMARK_TOKEN=pm_xxx                    # Your Postmark API token
POSTMARK_FROM=support@virtualaddresshub.co.uk  # Verified sender domain
POSTMARK_TO=support@virtualaddresshub.co.uk    # Where messages are received
```

**Optional Override:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://vah-api-staging.onrender.com  # For external API
```

### 🧪 Testing

#### Quick Manual Test
```bash
./test-contact.sh
```

#### API Tests
```bash
npm test tests/api.contact.test.ts
```

#### Manual Curl Test
```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name":"Test User",
    "email":"test@example.com",
    "subject":"Website enquiry",
    "message":"Hello from curl!",
    "website":""
  }'
```

### 🎯 Features

- **Email Security**: Uses verified sender in `From` header, customer email in `Reply-To`

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions
