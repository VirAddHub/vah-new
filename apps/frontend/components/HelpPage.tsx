    category: "Understanding Your Virtual Address",
    q: "What exactly is a Virtual Address with VirtualAddressHub?",
    a: `It's a real, physical UK office address for your business, without the traditional costs and commitment of renting an office. We handle your official mail by scanning and uploading it securely to your online dashboard—usually the same working day—all for £9.99 per month.`,
  },
  {
    id: "vah-registered-office",
    category: "Understanding Your Virtual Address",
    q: "Can I use your address as my official Registered Office & Director's Service Address?",
    a: `Absolutely. Our address is fully compliant for both your Registered Office and Director's Service Address with Companies House and HMRC. It meets the "appropriate address" requirements under the 2023 Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act.`,
  },
  {
    id: "vah-usage",
    category: "Understanding Your Virtual Address",
    q: "What can I use the address for in my day-to-day business?",
    a: `Use it for most professional correspondence: your website, invoices, contracts, and to open a UK business bank account.

Please note: The address cannot be used for personal post, residential use, retail goods returns, parcels, or DVLA documents. Unaccepted items will be refused or returned to sender.`,

  {
    id: "vah-royal-mail-redirect",
    category: "Understanding Your Virtual Address",
